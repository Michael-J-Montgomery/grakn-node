# Quickstart

Begin by importing the Grakn graph:

```
>>> var GraknGraph = require('grakn-node');

```

Now you can connect to a graph:

```
>>> var graph = new GraknGraph('http://localhost:4567', 'keyspace');

```

You can write to the graph:

```
>>> graph.execute('insert person sub entity;')
[]
>>> graph.execute('insert name sub resource, datatype string;')
[]
>>> graph.execute('insert person has name;')
[]
>>> graph.execute('insert $bob isa person, has name "Bob";')
['1234']

```

Or read from it:

```
>>> graph.execute('match $bob isa person, has name $name; select $name;')
[{'name': {'isa': 'name', 'id': '3141816', 'value': 'Bob'}}]

```
